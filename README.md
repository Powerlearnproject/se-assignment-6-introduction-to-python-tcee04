# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
   -     Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
         Some key features that make it popular among developers include:

          Easy to Learn and Use: Python has a simple and straightforward syntax, making it accessible to beginners.
         Versatility: Python can be used for various purposes, such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
         Large Standard Library: Python comes with a vast standard library that provides modules and functions for many common tasks, reducing the need for additional code.
         Community Support: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem by creating libraries, frameworks, and tools.
         Platform Independence: Python code can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
         Some examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective include web development with frameworks like Django or Flask, data analysis and visualization with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, machine learning and artificial intelligence with libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and automation of repetitive tasks.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   -     To install Python on your operating system:

         Windows:

         Download the Python installer from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
         Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
         Check the "Add Python to PATH" option during installation.
         To verify the installation, open a terminal or command prompt and type python --version or python3 --version. It should display the installed Python version.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   -     print("Hello, World!")
   -     In this program:

         print() is a built-in function used to display text on the console.
         "Hello, World!" is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.


4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   -     Basic data types in Python include:

         int: Integer numbers (e.g., 5, -3).
         float: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
         str: Strings (e.g., "hello", 'world').
         bool: Boolean values (True or False).

          # Integer variable
              num1 = 5

         # Float variable
             num2 = 3.14

         # String variable
            name = "Alice"

         # Boolean variable
             is_python_fun = True

         print(num1)
         print(num2)
         print(name)
         print(is_python_fun)



5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   -      Conditional statements and loops are used for decision-making and repetition in Python.
   -      Example of if-else statement:
   -       x = 10

          if x > 0:
               print("Positive")
         elif x == 0:
              print("Zero")
            else:
               print("Negative")
       
          Example of a for loop:
              for i in range(5):
                    print(i)



6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   -     Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, improving readability, and reducing redundancy.
   -     Here's a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
  
   -        
             def add(x, y):
             return x + y

              # Example of calling the function
              result = add(3, 5)
                   print(result)  # Output: 8

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   -      Lists: Ordered collections of items, accessed by index.
         Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.

          # List example
               numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

             # Dictionary example
                person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

          # Basic operations
                   print(numbers[0])  # Accessing the first element of the list
                   print(person["name"])  # Accessing value by key in dictionary


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   -     Exception handling in Python is a way to deal with errors gracefully. The try, except, and finally blocks are used for this purpose.
   -      try:
           x = 10 / 0
         except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Error: Division by zero")
         finally:
             print("This will always execute")


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   -     Modules in Python are files containing Python code. Packages are directories containing multiple modules. You can import and use modules in your script using the import statement.
   -     import math

         print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    -     You can read from and write to files in Python using file objects and built-in functions like open().
    -      Example of reading from a file:
   
    -          with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
            content = file.read()
              print(content)
      
Example of writing to a file:

               lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]

           with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")
